"""Behavioural tests for the args-line parser.

Both defects these cover were latent on the committed corpus, and were found by running
the parser against a real log rather than by reading it: none of the 68 committed sweeps
is a speculative arm, so neither produced a wrong committed value. Both would have fired
on the first MTP row, and 1,345 of the 5,090 vLLM rows on NVIDIA parts carry one.
