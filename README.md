# Inference Performance Estimation through BLIS

This repository contains the source code for BLIS (Blackbox Inference Simulator) for vLLM. It includes the scripts for building and running BLIS for diverse workloads and configurations.

## Main Goal

Develop a Discrete Event Simulator for estimating latency metrics given diverse vLLM workloads and configurations.

## 📦 Repository Setup

> Go >= 1.21 is required.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:inference-sim/inference-sim.git
cd inference-sim
go build -o simulation_worker main.go
```
